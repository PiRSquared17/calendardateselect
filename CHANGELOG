1.8.3 - Nov 12, 2007
* Improved close methods:
  * Added "OK" button at the bottom
	* Double clicking a day closes the calendar (not in IE, though... because IE is everyone's favorite browser to program for)
	* Escape key closes calendar
* Added optional close button at the top, which is hidden by default.  Don't use this unless you really need it, because it may disappear in the future.
* Don't focus a hidden element
* Navigate down to child input element if exists (in case a div tag is passed in).  Resolves problems when input control is wrapped with a error div.  Test cases
* Allow non-flexible, specific year ranges (pass in an array)
  * test case to chcek auto-repopulating of flexibleYearRanges
  * restrict year navigation inside of a non-flexible range
* Updated test cases
* Bugfix for duplicate days that were occuring across day-light-saving-time boundaries
* Added format_american.js (thanks, Wes)
* Added format_italian.js (thanks, Bigonazzi)
* Bugfix for Konqueror - Was showing blank white box for popup window - had to do with Iframe hack.
