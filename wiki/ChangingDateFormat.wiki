This is a quick guide on how to change the format of the date output by calendardateselect.


= Details =

Right now, when using calendardateselect, the date is in the following format:  July 4, 2007.  While that format is very readable, it may not suit your website needs.  Perhaps you need the date in a more database friendly format like YYYY-MM-DD.  The following steps will show you how to do so.

===Step 1===
Open up calendar_date_select.js

===Step 2===
Go down to line 31 and find the following code:

{{{
Date.prototype.toFormattedString = function(include_time){
  str = Date.months[this.getMonth()] + " " + this.getDate() + ", " + this.getFullYear();
  
  if (include_time) { hour=this.getHours(); str += " " + this.getAMPMHour() + ":" + this.getPaddedMinutes() + " " + this.getAMPM() }
  return str;
} 
}}}

This is the method that sets the format of the date.

===Step 3===
Comment out the second line, so you have it for future reference.

{{{
 //str = Date.months[this.getMonth()] + " " + this.getDate() + ", " + this.getFullYear();

}}}

===Step 4===
Paste the following code below what you just commented out:

{{{
str = this.getFullYear() + "-" + Date.padded2(this.getMonth() + 1) + "-" +Date.padded2(this.getDate()); 
}}}

This will return the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.  Notice how the code says (this.getMonth() + 1).  Adding the 1 is necessary because the months are stored in an array index at 0.  So January is 00 instead of 01, and adding 1 fixes that.

This is only a short tutorial on how to change the format one way, but hopefully it gives you an idea of how to make changes so you should be able to change a few things on your own.  If you still have questions, make sure to ask the mailing list.
